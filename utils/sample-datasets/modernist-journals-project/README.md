This folder contains network data for writers and artists who published together in modernist journals, which was compiled from [the metadata made available](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mjplab/files/) by the [Modernist Journals Project](http://modjourn.org/).

## Data & Methodology

### *The Crisis*

Nodes: 96; unimodal*

Edges: 273; weighted; undirected

### *Poetry* and *The Little Review*

Nodes: 391; unimodal*

Edges: 2,426; weighted; undirected

### *The Freewoman*, *The New Freewoman*, and *The Egoist*

Nodes: 269; unimodal*

Edges: 2,174; weighted; undirected

The nodes csvs contain authors, and the edges csvs contain weighted publication relationships between those authors, which were calculated based on how many times each author appeared with another author in the same journal issue. 

*The networks have been condensed to include only the top connections, such that each author in the network appears in at least two different issues with another author in the network. 

## Background & Significance

### *The Crisis* (1910-1922)

W. E. B. Du Bois founded *The Crisis* in 1910 as the official magazine of the NAACP. The magazine was, as the [Modernist Journals Project describes](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=crisiscollection), "arguably the most widely read and influential periodical about race and social injustice in U.S. history." *The Crisis* is, in fact, still being published today.

The issues included in the MJP and this network data span from 1910-1922, a time period during which the magazine covered "most every facet of life for blacks in America, devoting special issues to such topics as women's suffrage, education, children, labor, homes, vacations, and the war." The magazine also became "an important crucible" for the literary and arts movement known as the Harlem Renaissance.

Notable authors who published in *The Crisis* and are included in this dataset: W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset, Charles Chestnutt, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Claude McKay, and more.

### *Poetry* (1912-1922) and *The Little Review* (1914-1922)

Harriet Monroe founded *Poetry* in 1912, where, [according to the Modernist Journals Project](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=1202232622296875), she "not only published the best modern poetry she could find, but also used the pages of the magazine for debate and discussion about the forms and content of poetry proper for a modern age." *Poetry* is still being published today, though the network data here spans from 1912-1922.

Margaret Anderson founded *The Little Review* in 1914. During its 15-year life, *The Little Review* published imagist and experimental works, as well as, famously, a serialization of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.

Notable authors who published in *Poetry* and are included in this dataset: Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, Carl Sandburg, H.D., Richard Aldington, Alfred Kreymborg, and more.

Notable authors who published in *The Little Review* and are included in this dataset : Amy Lowell, Richard Aldington, T.S. Eliot, Djuna Barnes, Alfred Kreymborg, James Joyce, and more.

### *The Freewoman* (1911-1912), *The New Freewoman* (1913), and *The Egoist* (1914-1919)

Dora Marsden founded *The Freewoman* in 1911, a “Weekly Feminist Review” that, [according to the Modernist Journals Project](http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=LittleReviewCollection), addressed "issues such as prostitution, homosexuality, and other matters relating to class and gender."

After struggling financially, *The Freewoman* closed within a year. Dora Marsen then launched a second journal, *The New Freewoman*, which was, according to the MJP, "more literary than its predecessor."

Shortly after Ezra Pound got involved with *The New Freewoman*, the magazine evolved into *The Egoist*, becoming one of the most important modernist magazines, which published novels by James Joyce and Wyndham Lewis as well as  poetry and criticism by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot.

Notable authors who published in *The Freewoman* and are included in this dataset: Rebecca West, Muriel Ciolkowska, Dora Marsden ("Ed. of 'The Freewoman'"), and more.

Notable authors who published in *The New Freewoman* and are included in this dataset: Rebecca West, Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington, Dora Marsden, and more. 

Notable authors who published in *The Egoist* and are included in this dataset : Amy Lowell, William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore, Richard Aldington, Muriel Ciolkowska, Ezra Pound, Dora Marsen, T.S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, and more.

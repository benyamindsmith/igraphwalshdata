#' Dora Marsden founded *The Freewoman* in 1911, a “Weekly Feminist Review” that, \href{https://modjourn.org/}{according to the Modernist Journals Project}, addressed "issues such as prostitution, homosexuality, and other matters relating to class and gender."
#'
#' After struggling financially, *The Freewoman* closed within a year. Dora Marsen then launched a second journal, *The New Freewoman*, which was, according to the MJP, "more literary than its predecessor."
#'
#' Shortly after Ezra Pound got involved with *The New Freewoman*, the magazine evolved into *The Egoist*, becoming one of the most important modernist magazines, which published novels by James Joyce and Wyndham Lewis as well as  poetry and criticism by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot.
